About:

- Ruby 2.0.0

Note: The ruby gems must be installed before booting the rails server. This is a one time process.
In the terminal, navugate to the root folder and run the command -> bundle install
This need not be repeated everytime you run the server.

Starting the rails server:

Shutting down the server:

Notes:
- Once a video is uploaded, the pop up form window will close. The user must then refresh the window with the
video player, production notes, etc. in order to view the video clip uploaded.
